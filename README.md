## üìñ | Basics

1. Branch :`prod_state` -> Stores the abstract latest changes. Does not get packaged into Docker images.
2. Branch : `dev` -> Dev state. Does not get packaged into Docker images.
3. Branch : `stg`-> Stg state. Does not get packaged into Docker images.
4. Releases

### ‚öôÔ∏è | CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

As a reference this repository provides example CI/CD workflows to help you test your worker and build a docker image. The three main workflows are:

1. `CI-test_handler.yml` - Tests the handler using the input provided by the `--test_input` argument when calling the file containing your handler.

### Test Handler

This workflow will validate that your handler works as expected. You may need to add some dependency installations to the `CI-test_handler.yml` file to ensure your handler can be tested.

The action expects the following arguments to be available:

- `vars.RUNNER_24GB` | The endpoint ID on RunPod for a 24GB runner.
- `secrets.RUNPOD_API_KEY` | Your RunPod API key.
- `secrets.GH_PAT` | Your GitHub Personal Access Token.
- `vars.GH_ORG` | The GitHub organization that owns the repository, this is where the runner will be added to.

### Test End-to-End

This repository is setup to automatically build and push a docker image to the GitHub Container Registry. You will need to add the following to the GitHub Secrets for this repository to enable this functionality:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your DockerHub username for logging in.
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Your DockerHub token for logging in.

Additionally, the following need to be added as GitHub actions variables:

- `DOCKERHUB_REPO` | The name of the repository you want to push to.
- `DOCKERHUB_IMG` | The name of the image you want to push to.

The `CD-docker_dev.yml` file will build the image and push it to the `dev` tag, while the `CD-docker_release.yml` file will build the image on releases and tag it with the release version.


## üí° | Best Practices

System dependency installation, model caching, and other shell tasks should be added to the `builder/setup.sh` this will allow you to easily setup your Dockerfile as well as run CI/CD tasks.

Models should be part of your docker image, this can be accomplished by either copying them into the image or downloading them during the build process.

If using the input validation utility from the runpod python package, create a `schemas` python file where you can define the schemas, then import that file into your `handler.py` file.
